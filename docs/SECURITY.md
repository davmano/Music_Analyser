# Security Policy

## DevSecOps Implementation

This project implements comprehensive DevSecOps practices across the entire development and deployment lifecycle.

### Security Measures

#### 1. Code Security
- **Static Code Analysis**: SonarQube integration for code quality and security analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: OWASP Dependency Check and npm audit for vulnerability detection
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets, all sensitive data stored in Kubernetes secrets
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all API endpoints using Joi and express-validator

#### 2. Container Security
- **Base Images**: Using official, minimal base images (Alpine Linux)
- **Non-root Users**: All containers run as non-root users
- **Read-only Filesystems**: Containers use read-only root filesystems where possible
- **Capability Dropping**: All unnecessary Linux capabilities dropped
- **Image Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning for all container images

#### 3. Infrastructure Security
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes network policies restrict inter-pod communication
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for Kubernetes resources
- **TLS Encryption**: All external communication encrypted with TLS
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits set for all containers
- **Security Contexts**: Proper security contexts configured for all pods

#### 4. API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS**: Proper CORS configuration
- **Security Headers**: Helmet.js for security headers
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type validation and size limits

#### 5. Database Security
- **Authentication**: MongoDB with authentication enabled
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Connection Security**: Secure connection strings with credentials in secrets
- **Access Control**: Database access restricted to application services only

### Security Scanning

#### Automated Scans
- **Filesystem Scanning**: Trivy scans for vulnerabilities in source code
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy scans for vulnerabilities in Docker images
- **Dependency Scanning**: OWASP Dependency Check for known vulnerabilities
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube for security hotspots and code smells

#### CI/CD Security Gates
- Quality gates prevent deployment of code with security issues
- Failed security scans block the pipeline
- Manual approval required for production deployments

### Monitoring and Logging

#### Security Monitoring
- Application logs capture security events
- Failed authentication attempts logged
- File upload attempts logged with user information
- API access patterns monitored

#### Alerting
- Security scan failures trigger alerts
- Failed deployments notify security team
- Unusual API activity generates alerts

### Incident Response

#### Security Incident Handling
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and manual reporting
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Immediate steps to limit damage
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore services and monitor for recurrence
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review and improvements

### Compliance

#### Standards Adherence
- OWASP Top 10 security risks addressed
- Container security best practices followed
- Kubernetes security benchmarks implemented
- Regular security assessments conducted

### Security Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Backend Security
JWT_SECRET=<strong-random-secret>
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URL=<secure-connection-string>

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# File Upload
MAX_FILE_SIZE=52428800
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=audio/mpeg,audio/wav,audio/flac
```

#### Kubernetes Security
```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1001
  fsGroup: 1001
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
```

### Security Testing

#### Automated Testing
- Unit tests include security test cases
- Integration tests verify authentication and authorization
- End-to-end tests validate security controls

#### Manual Testing
- Penetration testing for critical vulnerabilities
- Security code reviews for sensitive components
- Configuration reviews for deployment security

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@company.com
- Encrypt sensitive information using our PGP key
- Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- Allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation

### Security Updates

- Security patches applied within 24 hours for critical issues
- Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities
- Monthly security reviews and assessments
- Quarterly security training for development team
